#Lab 5 Intro to C

Question 1) I saw that with the gcc compiler I get:
			Globals:  gi is 0, and gx is 0.000000
			Locals:  i is 32765, and x is 0.000000
and with tcc:
	Globals:  gi is 0, and gx is 0.000000
	Locals:  i is 0, and x is 0.000000
The value of local I has changed from 0 to 32765 in gcc for me. I expected both tcc and gcc to have the same output 

Question 2) bills.c

Question 3) Results of the evaluated expression
 		i j
 a)	8 3
 b)	3 4
 c) 	4 4
 d)	5 3 and 2 is the result of i % j 
 e)	5 4 and 2 is the result of i % j++

Question 4) 
	getchar is called like this:
		ch = getchar()
		while snanf worls like this 
		scanf ( "%c" , $ch)
		getchar also works faster than scanf in some aspects since it is much simpler.
		Lastly, getchar(), reads one character, and returns it.
		To save that character we need to use a variable. 
		Moreover, scanf has a tendency to leave behind charcters it has peeked at but not read, 
		including new line charcter. This causes an issue when getchar and scanf are used in the sames script


Question 5)
				Completed using tcc
				The result will be x = 0.000, y = 0.0000 and i = 45
				when compiled using gcc
				The result will be an error during compilation
