#Lab 5 
This Lab focused on creating three different scripts
	reextend
		This script takes two arguments from the command line. 
		The arguments have to be file name extensions. 
		The script changes the extensions of all files with the 
		.first_argument extension into the  .second_argument extension. 
	organiseMusic
		There are 2 versions present. 
		organiseMusic
			This file uses the function ArtistDirCreate and a for loop to create 
			directories by the name of song Artists in that directory. This only works
			if there are .mp3 files available in the directory.
			The name of the mp3 files have to be formatted to look like this:
			"Artist Name - Song Name.mp3"  
		testOrgMus
			This script tested the function used in the main file - organiseMusic.
			The function ArtistDirCreate, creates a directory by the Artist name given as
			an argument and moves all songs from that artist in created directory. It also
			removes the artist name from the file name before moving it. 
	count.bash
		There are 3 versions present.
		oldCount
			The oldCount script was created before I understood the 
		concept of regular files, thus I tried to use the file command
		to get the file type and compare that file type to a string. If the 
		file type matches the string, then prints out the words and lines in that file
		SecondDraftcount.bash
			Here I tried to use different Bash utilities such as ls, grep and awk. 
			That method was a little too long winded and inefficient. 
		count.bash
			This is much more concise and easier to understand. It is still the same logic,
			but utilizes bash commands more efficiently.
